Bubble Sort

The bubble encompasses two neighboring values. 

If the larger number is to the left, we swap those values. 

Then we slide the bubble over one position. 

Once the bubble reaches the end of the array, we know that the largest value is in its proper position. 

We can then repeat the process for all the values except for the last value, since we know that it is already in place. 

And then we'll do it again, and again, and again, until we know all values are in their proper positions.
